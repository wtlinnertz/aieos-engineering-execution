# End-to-End Example: Generic Service Deployment

This example demonstrates the **complete AI-assisted SDLC flow** from PRD through execution-ready work items.

The example is:
- Fully anonymized
- Tool-agnostic
- Aligned to aieos-engineering-execution templates and validators

---

## Scenario Summary

A team needs to introduce a **new internal service** that exposes a simple API for retrieving reference data.

The goal is to show:
- How intent is progressively constrained
- How validators gate promotion
- How work becomes execution-ready without redesign

---

## Artifact Flow

1. PRD
2. Architecture Context File (ACF)
3. System Architecture Design (SAD)
4. Design Context File (DCF)
5. Technical Design Document (TDD)
6. Work Design Document (WDD) — includes execution-ready work items and work groups
7. Operational Readiness Document (ORD) — evidence-based production readiness verification

Each artifact is frozen before promotion. The ORD is generated after execution and deployment, with evidence gathered from the deployed system.
