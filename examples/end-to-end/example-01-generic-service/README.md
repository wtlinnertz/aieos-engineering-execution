# End-to-End Example: Generic Service Deployment

This example demonstrates the **complete AI-assisted SDLC flow** from PRD through execution-ready Jira stories.

The example is:
- Fully anonymized
- Tool-agnostic
- Aligned to ai-sdlc-kit templates and validators

---

## Scenario Summary

A team needs to introduce a **new internal service** that exposes a simple API for retrieving reference data.

The goal is to show:
- How intent is progressively constrained
- How validators gate promotion
- How work becomes execution-ready without redesign

---

## Artifact Flow

1. PRD
2. Architecture Context File (ACF)
3. System Architecture Design (SAD)
4. Design Context File (DCF)
5. Technical Design Document (TDD)
6. Work Design Document (WDD)
7. Jira Stories (READY)

Each artifact is frozen before promotion.
