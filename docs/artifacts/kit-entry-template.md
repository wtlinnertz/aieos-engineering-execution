# EEK Kit Entry Record

A lightweight gate that must be completed and frozen before beginning artifact generation in the Engineering Execution Kit.

This record is **human-authored**. It is validated against `kit-entry-spec.md` before the PRD entry path begins.

---

## Document Control

- Record ID: (e.g., KER-2026-001)
- Date:
- Initiated By:
- Work Summary: (1-2 sentences describing what this EEK engagement will deliver)
- Governance Model Version: 1.0
- Prompt Version: N/A
- Spec Version: {spec version}
- Principles Version: {principles file versions}

---

## Classification Check

Select one:

- [ ] **Classification record exists** — Work Classification Record ID: _____________
  Confirm the record routes to: Engineering Execution Kit
- [ ] **No classification record** — Justification for absence:
  _(Must be specific. State why classification was not performed — e.g., "Bug fix routed directly from incident response; classification not applicable." Generic statements such as "N/A" or "skipped" are not accepted.)_

---

## Entry Path

Select exactly one:

- [ ] **Path A — Discovery Entry**
  Frozen DPRD reference (document ID, file path, or link): _____________

  EL experiment references (EXP-N) present in DPRD Assumptions section:
  - [ ] Yes — EXP-N references are present for tested assumptions
  - [ ] No — Explanation: _____________
  _(Required. If No, state why EL references are absent — e.g., "All assumptions were validated as established facts before discovery; no experiments were conducted." Blank is not accepted.)_

- [ ] **Path B — Direct Entry (discovery bypassed)**
  Work type:
  - [ ] Bug Fix
  - [ ] Tech Debt
  - [ ] Compliance Mandate
  - [ ] Other: _____________

  Justification for bypassing discovery:
  _(Must be specific and consistent with the work type selected above — e.g., "Bug Fix: reproduction steps confirmed in staging; no design decision required; no user-facing behavior change beyond restoring correct function." Vague rationale such as "small change" or "no time" is not accepted.)_

---

## Priority Decision

- Priority decision on record: Yes / No
- Reference (date + approver name, planning session, or tracking system ID): _____________

---

## Scope Boundary

State what this work covers and what it does not:

**In scope:** (1-3 sentences)

**Out of scope:** (1-3 sentences — what related work is explicitly excluded)

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before validating and freezing this record, confirm:

- [ ] Record ID and date are present
- [ ] Classification check is complete (record referenced or absence justified)
- [ ] If classification record exists, it routes to EEK
- [ ] Exactly one entry path is selected
- [ ] Path A: DPRD reference is provided
- [ ] Path A: EL experiment references field is completed (Yes or No with explanation)
- [ ] Path B: work type is explicitly selected
- [ ] Path B: specific justification is documented and consistent with work type
- [ ] Priority decision has a traceable reference
- [ ] Scope boundary states both in scope and out of scope
