# ai-sdlc-kit Documentation

Welcome to **ai-sdlc-kit** — a practical toolkit for using AI safely across the full **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.

This documentation explains **how to use the kit**, **why it works**, and **how the pieces fit together**.

---

## Start Here

If you’re new to the kit, follow this order:

1. **Understand the process**
   - Read the **Playbook** to learn the end-to-end flow, gates, and freeze points.

2. **Use the templates**
   - Generate SDLC artifacts using the **AI-first templates**.

3. **Apply validators**
   - Run validators to determine readiness before promotion.

4. **Learn by example**
   - Walk through the anonymized, end-to-end examples.

---

## Core Concepts

The kit is built on a few simple ideas:

- **AI generates, validators decide**
- **Artifacts are promoted, not rewritten**
- **Execution artifacts are stricter than design artifacts**
- **Ambiguity is a failure condition**
- **Non-goals are enforceable**

These principles are applied consistently across all artifacts and validators.

## Documentation Sections

### 📘 Playbook
Defines the canonical process:
- Artifact flow and promotion rules
- Refinement ladders
- Freeze points
- Intent verification (built into prompts)
- Enforcement responsibilities

➡️ See: `playbook.md`

---

### 📄 Artifact Templates
Lean, AI-first templates for each SDLC stage:
- PRD
- ACF
- SAD
- DCF
- TDD
- WDD
- Story templates

Templates are designed to:
- Be passed directly to AI
- Produce consistent structure
- Be easy to validate

➡️ See: `artifacts/`

---

### ✅ Validators
Strict, non-prescriptive readiness gates:
- PRD Validator
- ACF Validator
- SAD Validator
- DCF Validator
- TDD Validator
- WDD Validator
- Definition of Ready (DoR) Validator

Validators determine **readiness**, not correctness or implementation quality.

➡️ See: `validators/`

---

### 🧪 Examples
Anonymized examples showing:
- Artifact evolution from PRD to execution
- Validator PASS/FAIL outputs
- What “good” looks like in practice

➡️ See: `../examples/`

## How to Use This Kit with AI

A typical flow looks like this:

1. Provide the AI with:
   - The upstream artifact
   - The relevant template
   - Any applicable context files (ACF, DCF)

2. Generate the artifact using the template (intent verification is built into the prompt).

3. Run the corresponding validator.

4. Fix only blocking issues.

6. Freeze and promote the artifact.

Repeat until you reach execution-ready work.

## Anonymization & Safety

This is a public repository.

All examples and templates:
- Avoid real company names
- Use placeholders for identifiers
- Remain tool- and employer-neutral

## Where to Go Next

- Read the **Playbook** → `playbook.md`
- Browse **Templates** → `artifacts/`
- Review **Validators** → `validators/`
- Explore **Examples** → `../examples/`

This kit is intentionally disciplined.

The structure you see here exists to make AI-assisted delivery **predictable, safe, and repeatable**.
