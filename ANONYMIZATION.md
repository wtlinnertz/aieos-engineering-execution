# ANONYMIZATION

This document defines the **mandatory anonymization rules** for all content in the **ai-sdlc-kit** repository.

The goal is to ensure this repository remains:
- Publicly shareable
- Employer-neutral
- Tool-agnostic
- Safe for reuse and contribution
- Suitable for AI-assisted generation and validation

These rules apply to **all files**, including examples, templates, validators, diagrams, and documentation.

---

## Core Rule

> **No content may reference a real employer, internal system, or proprietary environment.**

If there is any doubt, **anonymize**.

## Required Anonymization Patterns

When examples require realism, use **explicit placeholders**.

### Approved Placeholder Conventions

Use ALL CAPS placeholders consistently:

- `ORG_NAME`
- `TEAM_NAME`
- `SERVICE_NAME`
- `SYSTEM_NAME`
- `REPO_NAME`
- `CLUSTER_NAME`
- `ENV_NAME`
- `PIPELINE_NAME`
- `USER_NAME`

---

### Domains & URLs
Use:
- `example.com`
- `api.example.com`
- `git.example.com`

Never use:
- Real company domains
- Personal domains

---

### Environments
Use generic names only:
- `dev`
- `test`
- `preprod`
- `prod`

Avoid:
- Internally meaningful environment names
- Region- or datacenter-specific labels

---

### Cloud & Platform References
Allowed:
- Generic cloud provider references (e.g., “a managed Kubernetes cluster”)
- Open-source project names

Avoid:
- Internal landing zones
- Account naming schemes
- Tenant identifiers
